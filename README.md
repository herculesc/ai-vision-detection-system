# 🧠 AI Vision SaaS — People Detection System

A full-stack Computer Vision SaaS application that detects and counts people in images using **YOLO, FastAPI, and Streamlit**, with **JWT authentication and secure API access**.

This project demonstrates a production-style AI system with authentication, API protection, and a modern web interface.

## 🚀 What this system does

This system turns image uploads into structured AI insights in real time.

It can:

* 🔐 Authenticate users using JWT tokens
* 🧠 Detect people in images using YOLO
* 🔢 Count detected objects in real time
* 🖼️ Generate annotated images with bounding boxes
* 🌐 Serve results via REST API (FastAPI)
* 💻 Provide a SaaS-style web interface (Streamlit)
* 🔒 Protect AI endpoints with authentication

---

## 🔥 New Features (SaaS Upgrade)

Compared to a basic AI demo, this version includes:

* 🔐 Login system (JWT authentication)
* 🛡️ Protected API endpoints (/detect secured)
* 👤 Session-based frontend authentication
* 🚪 Logout functionality
* 🌐 REST API architecture (frontend/backend separation)
* 📦 Image storage system (uploads & outputs)
* 🔗 Image serving via API URL
* 💼 SaaS-ready structure

---

## 💡 Why this project matters

This project simulates a real-world AI SaaS product architecture:

* AI model is isolated from UI
* Backend exposes secure API endpoints
* Frontend consumes API like a real product
* Authentication layer protects resources
* System is modular and scalable

👉 This is a deployable AI SaaS prototype.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

```text
User
   ↓
Streamlit Frontend (Login + UI)
   ↓
JWT Authentication Request
   ↓
FastAPI Backend (/login)
   ↓
JWT Token Issued
   ↓
User uploads image
   ↓
Streamlit → /detect (with JWT token)
   ↓
FastAPI validates token
   ↓
YOLO Model Inference
   ↓
OpenCV Image Processing
   ↓
Save annotated image
   ↓
Return:
- People count
- Image URL

```

---

## 🔐 Authentication Flow

```text
Login Request
   ↓
FastAPI verifies credentials
   ↓
JWT token generated
   ↓
Token stored in Streamlit session
   ↓
Token sent in Authorization header
   ↓
Backend validates token on /detect
```
